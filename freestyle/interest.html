<h1>My interest</h1>
<body>
<p>I feel like one of the more important things you can do in life is make time
for the things that interest you. I personally love trying out new tech when it comes to new laptop models,
video game consoles, really just new hardware in general.
Ive had such an early exposure to tech that its something that has always interested me.</p>
<p>
    I also enjoy personal fitness and try to hit the gym as much as I can, If Im unable to goto the gym
    I love sprinting through my neighborhood listening to whatever album Im in the mood
    to listen to.
</p>
<p>
    One of my other interest includes cooking for my friends and family, I love looking up new recipes online
    that serve as a challenge to get correct. When it comes to food one of the things I love most about
    living in Pittsburgh is the variety of restaurants Im surrounded by that afford me a window into other cultures
    through cuisine.
